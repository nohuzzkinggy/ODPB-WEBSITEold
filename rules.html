  <h1>Community Rules</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Only one bounce – The ball can only hit the ground once. If the ball hits the ground more than once, it is the point to the opposing team.</li>
    <li>Only the Orion Edge or VRML Paddles – This is to make it fair, as having a “pay to win” paddle with the Skel.EXE bundle (as it has a bigger hitbox) is not fair to players who do not have it. There will be compromises in the future.</li>
    <li>Serve underhand only – Serves must always be made with an underhand motion. Overhand serves are not allowed.</li>
    <li>Diagonal serving – The ball must be served diagonally into the opponent’s service box. A straight-across serve is a fault.</li>
    <li>Stay out of the kitchen – You cannot volley (hit the ball before it bounces) while standing inside the “kitchen” area near the net. You must let the ball bounce first if you are in the kitchen.</li>
    <li>Points are scored on serve – Only the serving side can score points. If the receiving team wins the rally, they gain the serve instead of the point.</li>
    <li>Win by 2 – A game is normally played to 11 points, but you must win by at least 2 points (e.g., 11–9, 12–10, etc.).</li>
    <li>Small ball only – You may only use the small heartball, and not the big/default one.</li>
  </ul>
